Gameplay Feel/Notes:
	**when hit with harpoon, crabs should flip (3s), exposing weak spot
	attack then back away ~3
	make front of model a leg side of the crab, so that the forward
	is sideways

Armor Damage
	if(hit == armor)
		if (armorHP > 0)
			armorHP -= dmg
		else
			HP -= dmg
something like this so if the armor is hit, it takes dmg
	if the armor is hit, but is at 0, the dmg goes to the HP
