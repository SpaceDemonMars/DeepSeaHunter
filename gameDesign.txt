GDB229 Project and Portfolio
Game Idea

Name (wip) : Deep Sea Hunter
Genre : FPS
Premise : Undersea spear fishing

Ideas
Weapon (Main): Harpoon Gun
		On hit will pull player towards heavy objects (terrain or large enemies)
		or pull light objects (small enemies/loot) to player
Weapon (Secondary): Knife

Player taking damage HUD : glass cracks, like scuba helmet being broken	
				more damage >> more cracks

Gameplay mechanic Ideas :
	-Eat fish for buffs
	-Breakable terrain
	-Harpoon can be charged before firing for more damage/range
	-look into boids again for a school of fish
	-weighted boots to walk on ocean floor
	-dash/evade instead of sprint (maybe)

Enemy Ideas :
	-Final Boss Leviathan (combine elements from all enemies)
	-Crabs : armored top(will flip if pulled by harpoon, only takes knife damage)
	-Swordfish/Sawfish/Marlin/Sharks : player colliding with them will cause damage, will use charge attacks
	-??? : (some sorta fish that looks like it could use a beam attack) fires a water beam
	-School of fish : player collision takes damage, higher toward the center, sustained while in contact
	-low level versions of the above, as more basic fish
	-barrel (for tutorial)

Trap Ideas : 
	-jellyfish : nondamaging, cause a paralysis on contact
	-urchin : think spike trap
	-Pufferfish : after taking damage, will puff up
			player colliding with puffed fish get poison DOT
	-kelp that slows player/blocks shots (breakable)

Terrain Ideas :
	rock formations/coral (breakable, should create rubble)
	undersea ruins (for boss stage, partially breakable, create rubble)
